Does aromatherapy foot massage reduce systolic blood pressure (SBP) in adults?

Healthy Japanese adults
->
Baseline data:
Group A: Foot massage ->(week4 data) Non-intervention (week8 data)
Group B: Non-intervention ->(week4 data) Foot massage (week8 data)

Data Structure:
Analyse the design in terms of:
•	Number and identity of comparison groups
•	Type of comparison groups (matched vs. independent)
•	Types of variables

Variable: differences (after-before) in SBP
parameter: mean

Null hypothesis (Ho): 
mu_diff = 0
The mean difference in systolic blood pressure is zero.

Alternative hypothesis (HA): 
mu_diff < 0
The mean difference in systolic blood pressure is less than zero.

Data manipulation required calculating:	sysBPafter-sysi
•	mean SBP (“mSBP”) from two measurements per individual for each time point
•	differences in mSBP per individual to compare foot massage (‘after’) minus no intervention (‘before’) (paired comparison groups)
•	differences in SBP paid attention to the group (treatment order randomization)
