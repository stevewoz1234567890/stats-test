There is some concern that when school-age children spend time using screened devices (e.g. smartphones, tablets, TVs, computers, etc.), they are not as active as they should be. With lower physical activity, childhood obesity becomes a concern. Research has suggested that poor health in childhood can be a precursor to poor health as an adult. One simple measure of physical health that can be calculated with very little information is the body mass index (BMI)
The value of BMI for an individual is compared against a ‘normal’ range to evaluate the individual’s health. The ‘normal’ range of BMI for school age children is between 15.2 and 18.0 kg/m2 (with a midpoint of 17.6 kg/m2). Arguably, if the use of screens leads to poorer health, then we might expect mean BMI to be higher for children whose mean daily screentime is above the average (which has been reported as 6 h/day). Consequently, we can address the following Research Question:
Do school-age children who have a typical daily screentime of more than 6 h have a body mass index above the ‘normal’ midpoint for school-age children?
You will be conducting a null hypothesis test, specifically, the t test for the mean, to assess evidence for the claim, the mean BMI for school age children who use screens more than 6 h/day is higher than midpoint BMI of school-age children, to answer that Research Question.
